                                                                           I would like to use this program to implement the function of storing and modifying   the basic information (e.g., student name, student number, math grade, physics grade, chemistry grade), and using this information to understand the performance of students' grades from multiple perspectives
                                                                           We use two functions, add and load student information file, to get the basic information of students(name, student number, math grade, physics grade, chemistry grade), and then further process this information by modifying, deleting and other functions, and can save the updated student information to the file. Finally, we can use the basic student information to get the student's grades, GPA and ranking in each subject
